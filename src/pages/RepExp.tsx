          $28.7 million federal jury award under Federal and Delaware law in

          three-year battle involving dozens of lawyers. Post-verdict motions
          upheld $6 million in punitive damages. This verdict also led to the

          no cost, requiring one former owner to spend $20 million to fully
          remediate the disputed area and a later settlement binding the other
          former owners to inject $50 million for future remediation.
